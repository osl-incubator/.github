# Open Science Labs Incubator Program

The Open Science Labs (OSL) Incubator Program aims to help our community, 
providing a github organization where anyone from our community can develop their projects,
under an open source license.

In the OSL Incubator program some collaborators from our community voluntarily will offer help with review and guidance.

Regarding to the programming language used, some guides are recommended. For example, for Python projects, we are
using the guideline provided by [pyopensci.org](pyopensci.org).

When the project is already mature and are using all the best practices recommendations, the project would be able to
be moved to another github organization for approved projects: https://github.com/osl-projects
